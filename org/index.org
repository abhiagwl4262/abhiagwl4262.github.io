* Overview
(site last updated: {{{modification-time(%Y %B %d)}}})

I am a postdoctoral research fellow studying tropical overturning circulations
(i.e. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon][monsoons]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_cell][Hadley cells]], and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone][Intertropical Convergence Zone]], a.k.a. the
ITCZ).  I work jointly in the California Institute of Technology Division of
Geological and Planetary Sciences (GPS) with [[http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~bordoni/][Prof. Simona Bordoni]] and in the
UCLA Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences (EPSS) with
[[http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~mitch/Home.html][Prof. Jonathan Mitchell]].  Please see my [[file:research.org][Research]] page for more.

I am also interested in the [[http://www.openscience.org/blog/][Open Science]] and [[http://opensource.org/][Open Source Software]] movements,
which manifests through developing open-source software tools for scientists in
the Python programming language.  Please see the [[file:aospy.org]["aospy"]],
[[file:programming.org][Programming]], and [[file:resources.org][Resources]] pages for more.

I am also co-leader of the "[[https://diynamics.github.io/][DIYnamics]]" project that seeks to improve the
teaching of meteorology, climate science, and other planetary-scale sciences at
the K-12 through graduate school levels by developing inexpensive, easy-to-use
kits for performing physical demonstrations of core scientific concepts.  Please
see the [[file:outreach.org][DIYnamics]] page for more.

Please contact me (information below) with any questions about my research or
anything else you find on this site.  Thanks!
